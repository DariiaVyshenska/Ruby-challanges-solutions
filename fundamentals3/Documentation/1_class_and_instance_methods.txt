Locate the ruby documentation for methods File::path and File#path:
  - go to ruby Core API
  - find class 'File'
  - on the left side locate both methods (can use quick search)
How are they different?
  - File::path is a class method, File#path is an instance method.
  - The File::path method is called on a class, output is the string 
  representation of the path
  - The #path method is called on the object of a class method, output is the 
  pathname (as a string) used to create this file instance.
