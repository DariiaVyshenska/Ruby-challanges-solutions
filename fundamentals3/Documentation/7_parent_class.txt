- find #public_methods in Object Class Core API (go to Core API, in the 
search bar for methods only you can easily locate this method without the 
need to go over all possible Classes)
- API specifies that this method has parameter all set to be true as default. 
- if we set all to false, only the methods in the receiver will be listed.
- therefore we need to modify our code the following way:
puts s.public_methods(all=false).inspect
