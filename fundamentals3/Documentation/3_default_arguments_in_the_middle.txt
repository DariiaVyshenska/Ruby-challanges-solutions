It prints out:
[4, 5, 3, 6]

We can find explanation to what happens on the page for syntax, calling methods.
What happens here is the following:
- the method has 4 arguments, seconod and third have default values (b=2 and c=3);
- we pass three numbers to the method (4, 5, 6);
- first passed argument fills in first method's argument without default (a=4);
- last passed argument fills in last method's argument that is also not set to default (d=6);
- we have one passed argument left, so it will replace first default method's argument (5 replaces 2 -> now b=5)
