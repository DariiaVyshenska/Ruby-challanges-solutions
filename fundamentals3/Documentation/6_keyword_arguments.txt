- we go to the Core API, Class Numeric, instance method #step
- the method has four calling signatures. We are using one of them: 
step(by: step, to: limit) {|i| block } â†’ selfclick to toggle s
- according to the API, this method invokes the given block on a sequence of
numbers that start from numer on which #step was called (in our case it is 5). 
Our sequence goes up to numer 10 and has step 3. In other words, we generate 
sequence '5 8'. The block is called on each element of this seqience. Therefore,
we will have the following output:
5
8
